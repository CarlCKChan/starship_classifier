# Predict what series a starship comes

A very basic site that allows someone to pass an image URL of a starship to my starship classification model.
Currently only supports Star Trek (Federation), Star Wars (Empire), and Dead Space.

My model is hosted at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/CCKC/fastai_st_sw_ds_ship_classifier
The API documentation can also be found there as well.
